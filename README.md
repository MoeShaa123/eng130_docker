## Docker

- Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.

- Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

- Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

## Microservices

- Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services.

- With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled.

- With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.
