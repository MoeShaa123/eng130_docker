<h1>Mohamed Yusuf's Profile</h1>
<p> I am currently working at Sparta Global as a Junior Devops Engineer. I studied Financial Maths at University a few years ago and within that degree I did a course called
    Mathematical computing, where I was exposed to Python. And this is where my passion for coding began.
    While I used to work as an Accounts Assistant, in a team of 6 people I've learnt how to work with others and this is
    especially important when working in DevOps. Over the past few years I have been trying to make a career change into IT
    and the cloud as it was something I really wanted to do, something I was always passionate about. The world of the
    cloud is always expanding and there is always something new to learn. While I wasn't working I did my own research and
    projects to expand my knowledge in coding and a few months ago I completed an AWS course and passed the AWS cloud practitioner
    certification. I'm excited to train and develop my technical skills as well as my soft skills while working here at Sparta
    Global and I would like to progress my career as a DevOps Engineer. In my free time I enjoy watching and playing football,
    and watching TV series.
